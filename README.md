# jQuery Data Remote

jQuery Data Remote is a plugin that simplifies the common task of making api/remote requests and injecting the response to the page. Optionally leverages Handlebars.js for templating. Yes, the name is inpired by rails.

## Demo

To view the demo I'll typically use php's built-in web server.

```sh
# port 8080 might not work for you, change it to whatever you like
$ php -S localhost:8080
```

Now to view the demo, go to [http://localhost:8080/demo](http://localhost:8080/demo)

## To Do

* Add build tools
* Add support for POST requests
* Add support for authenticated requests
* Add support for multiple JS templating engines, not just handlebars
* Add built-in support for paginating responses?
* Add better error handling
